#Stars in eyes

if you rearrange the black circular parts, they are ellipsis
the smaller one is a circle which is a special ellipsis where radiuses are equal

The formula for the area of an ellipsis is Pi*a*b where a, b are radiuses of the ellipsis.

For the circle a=b so we have pi*a^2 which is the area of a disc

we just have to substract the black area from the rectangle area to get the star area
